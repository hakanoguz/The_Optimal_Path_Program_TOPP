# The Optimal Path Program (TOPP)
This tool was written with Python on October 2nd, 2022 by Hakan OGUZ. This program finds the optimal path in a digital elevation model (DEM) between two points. The optimal path was calculated in 4 steps:
1) Load DEM image
2) Create slope image
3) Calculate optimal path in raster format
4) Convert path to shapefile (line)
